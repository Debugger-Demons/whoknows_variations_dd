- Notes

  We are software engineers because we built blueprints for our work, but are like other engineers ?
  When it comes to software it is easier to be agile, than hardware.
  It is dangerous to think you know better than the users who work in their domain.
  As a software engineer you can work in a domain for several years, and think you know it all, but that is dangerous. In the end you are still a software engineer, and a sales man in the car industry know their domain better than you, so you must always take their input. However, not every user input is valuable but some are. Just take that into consideration.

  You cannot use devops in the waterfall model.

  DevOps and software engineers have different roles. They might not even use the same tools.
